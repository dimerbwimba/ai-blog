# Travel Blog with AI Integration - Next.js Project

This is a **Next.js** project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). This travel blog features AI-powered content generation to make it more interactive and informative.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide an engaging and dynamic travel blog experience with the power of **AI** to generate travel content such as recommendations, itineraries, and personalized travel tips based on user input.

### Features:
- **Dynamic Travel Blog**: Posts, categories, and tags can be easily managed and updated.
- **AI-Powered Content**: Use of AI tools to generate travel content and recommendations.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop users.
- **Next.js Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Optimized performance and SEO using SSR.
- **Optimized Fonts**: The project uses Next.js's `next/font` to load and optimize the Geist font family.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development setup, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use your preferred package manager to install dependencies.

For **npm**:
```bash
npm install
```

For **yarn**:
```bash
yarn install
```

For **pnpm**:
```bash
pnpm install
```

For **bun**:
```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

After that, you can open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your travel blog in action.

### 4. Start Editing

You can start editing the pages by modifying `app/page.tsx` and other relevant files in the `app` folder. Changes will be reflected in real-time as you update the files.

## AI Integration

This travel blog features AI-powered content for personalized travel experiences. The AI can provide:

- **Personalized Travel Recommendations**: Based on user input (destination preferences, budget, activities).
- **Custom Itinerary Generation**: AI generates travel itineraries based on user preferences and interests.
- **Interactive Travel Tips**: AI-generated tips based on specific destinations.

Ensure you have the required **API keys** for AI integration and store them securely in your `.env.local` file.
